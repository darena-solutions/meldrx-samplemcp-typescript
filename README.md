## Building

- run `npm install`
- run `npm run dev` to run the server

## Debugging

To debug, we have tested with VS code and the `tsx` package.

- Ensure you have `index.ts` opened in VS code and it is your active tab
- In VS code, on the left hand pane, select the `Run and Debug` menu.
- In the dropdown select `tsx`, and click the green play button.
  - If the server starts and then immediately stops, it is likely the `index.ts`
    file is not opened in VS code, or it might not be the active tab. Ensure `index.ts`
    is opened and the active tab.
